                        Research Focus and Expertise

                        The Space Technology Research Center (STRC) at Future University focuses on a selected number of strategic research areas in space technology and aerospace engineering. The center's faculty and researchers have deep expertise in the following domains:

                        Satellite design and system engineering
                        Spacecraft propulsion and power systems
                        Remote sensing and Earth observation technologies
                        Space communications and navigation
                        While the STRC may not have the elaborate testing facilities of larger research centers, the team leverages partnerships with industry, government agencies, and other academic institutions to access specialized equipment and infrastructure as needed. This collaborative approach allows the center to punch above its weight and make meaningful contributions to the advancement of space technology.

                        The STRC also places a strong emphasis on hands-on student engagement, providing undergraduates and graduate students with research opportunities and project-based learning experiences. This helps cultivate the next generation of space technology innovators and leaders.

                        By focusing its efforts on select research areas and fostering a culture of collaboration, the Space Technology Research Center at Future University aims to have a notable impact on the space industry and the broader scientific community.
